## What Is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual money that exists only online. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars or euros, cryptocurrencies are not issued or controlled by banks or governments. Instead, they use advanced technology to enable secure, peer-to-peer transactions across the internet.

The word _cryptocurrency_ comes from [**cryptography**](/cryptographic-tools-in-computer-security), a method of protecting information using complex codes. This technology ensures that transactions are secure, transparent, and difficult to alter.

## How Does Cryptocurrency Work?

Cryptocurrencies operate on a technology called [**blockchain**](/blockchain-explained). A blockchain is a public digital ledger that records every transaction made using a specific cryptocurrency.

Here’s a simple breakdown:

- Transactions are grouped into blocks
    
- Each block is linked to the previous one
    
- Once recorded, data cannot easily be changed
    

This system removes the need for a central authority, such as a bank, and allows users to send money directly to one another.

## What Is Blockchain Technology?

Blockchain is the backbone of cryptocurrency. It is a decentralized network maintained by thousands of computers (called nodes) around the world. Because the data is shared across many systems, no single entity has full control, making the network highly secure and transparent.

Key benefits of blockchain include:

- High security
    
- Transparency
    
- Resistance to fraud
    
- No single point of failure
