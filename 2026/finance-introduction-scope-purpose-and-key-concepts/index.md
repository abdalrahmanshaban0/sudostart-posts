## What Is Finance?

Finance is the discipline concerned with the **management of money, capital, and financial resources**. It studies how funds are raised, allocated, invested, and controlled over time while accounting for risk and uncertainty.

Unlike accounting—which records and reports past financial events—finance is **forward-looking**. It focuses on answering questions such as:

- How should available funds be invested?
    
- What is the cost of raising capital?
    
- How can financial risks be reduced?
    
- How can value be maximized over time?
    

In essence, finance is about **planning today for a better financial future**.

Adequate liquidity is essential for meeting short-term obligations and emergencies.
